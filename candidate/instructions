    Look at CandidatePool_Skeleton.java and read the comment at the top
        CandidatePool contains three methods that you must complete
        Write these methods and change the file name from CandidatePool_Skeleton.java to CandidatePool.java
    You do not need to modify CandidatePoolTest.java at all, it only contains a main method that will test your solutions to the methods in CandidatePool
    Compile the three .java files and run CandidatePoolTest (the only file with a main method), to check your work.
    ONLY SUBMIT CandidatePool.java

Submit this as candidate-pool
